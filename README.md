### Description

This program is probably the best program I have ever done. Although I had to borrow some codes to make it perfect. This is the last vesion. Look at the screenshot and you can see that I have rounded corners on the form and a SYSTRAY when the form is minimized. You can put background pictures in and you can preview them also. There is a HELP section in there just about the program. Thanks in advance and PLEASE LEAVE COMMENTS and VOTE APPROPRIATLY.
